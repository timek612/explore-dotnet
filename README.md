# .NET Exploration

We've explored server-side programming with JavaScript, but there are many other options out there. In this assignment, we're going to take a look at working in .NET.

There won't be a lot of information here on exactly what you should do: the intention is for to practice learning new technology on your own.

You should work through this assignment yourself, but check in with your group as you go to share what you are learning, useful resources, and ask questions.

## .NET vs. C#

**.NET is a _framework_ and _runtime_ that works with the C# language.** When researching .NET, you may often come across documentation that refers to both .NET and C#. For the purposes of this assignment, you can consider these two terms 
to be part of the same single technology.

See https://stackoverflow.com/q/2724864/830030

## VSCode

While there are many different editors which work well with .NET and C#, please continue to use VSCode.

## Objectives

- install tools required to work with a new language
- explore basic syntax (variables, types, data structures, loops, conditionals, functions) of new language
- solve a logic problem in a new language
- understand some of the key concepts that differentiate .NET from Javascript


## Setup and _Hello World_

You will need to install .NET on your computer, and get it up and running on your computer. It is a programming convention to always start learning a new tech by creating a _Hello World_ application: this is a program that logs the string `"Hello World"` to your terminal. 

Google is your friend for this assignment! For example, try searching for:

- _Install .net mac_
- _.net getting started_
- _.net hello world tutorial_

Create a new github repo called `dotnet-hello-world`, which logs the string `"Hello World"` to your terminal.

## Code Katas

Our next step to understand the basic syntax and structure of .NET and C#, including:

- Variables, numbers, data types
- Conditionals
- Loops and arrays (aka "lists")
- Data structures
- Functions

Thing of this like a super-compressed version of Tier 1!

Our end goals is to be able to complete a few [Code "katas"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)). These are small coding exercises to help you build up skills in a language. 

For this assignment you will need to complete the following katas from codewars.com:

- [Opposites attracts](https://www.codewars.com/kata/555086d53eac039a2a000083/train/csharp) (numbers and conditionals)
- [You only need one](https://www.codewars.com/kata/57cc975ed542d3148f00015b/train/csharp) (lists and loops)
- [Sum of positives](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5715eaedb436cf5606000381/train/csharp) (lists, conditionals, numbers)

You may solve these online on codewars.com, but please copy your solutions into new files in your `dotnet-hello-world` assignment.
